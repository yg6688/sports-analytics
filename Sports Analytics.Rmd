## R and R Markdown
R is one of the most popular statistical programming languages. R is the only widely-used statistical programming language that is free and open source, with a wide developer community that contributes to the core language and corresponding packages. This file was created with RStudio, our recommended IDE for use with R. For more information and to download, see <https://rstudio.com>.

This is an R Markdown document generated by knitr and RStudio. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk and its corresponding output like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```
